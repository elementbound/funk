/* Collections in Funk */

/* Missing arrays? Lists? Maps? Tuples? 
No more tears need to be shed, fam! Funk got you covered! 
Here, take a look at Funk Laboratories' new scientific achievement:

Collections 

Collections can be almost anything you want. For example, arrays: */

array = !.Collection();
array[] = "fam";
array[] = "son";
array[] = "boy";

rng = !.Random(); 
end = rng.number(0, array.size()-1).round();
end = array[end];

("Funk got you covered, " + end + "!").println();
"Here's your array: ".print();
array.println(); 

/* Collections can be maps: */

orcish = !.Collection(); 
orcish["Aka'magosh"] = "A blessing on you and yours.";
orcish["Dabu"] = "I obey.";
orcish["Gol'kosh!"] = "By my axe!";
orcish["Lok-Narash!"] = "Arm yourselves!";
orcish["Lok-Tar!"] = "Victory!";
orcish["Lok-Tar Ogar!"] = "Victory or death!";
orcish["Swobu"] = "As you command.";
orcish["Throm-Ka"] = "Well met.";
orcish["Zug-zug"] = "Okay.";
/* Source: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3881722211 */

/* Collections are basically a list of key-value pairs. A key or a value can be any kind of 
Funk object. */

/* You can iterate through your collections. Let's print our orcish dictionary. */
"Known orcish phrases: ".println(); 
for(orcish.rewind(); orcish.pastEnd() == False; orcish.next()) {
	"    ".print();
	orcish.key.print();
	": ".print();
	orcish.value.println();
}
"".println();

/* Iterating through collections work pretty much like watching a video tape: 
You rewind it, watch the whole thing, and finish once you are at the tape's end */

/* You can also check if a collection qualifies as an array: */
("array.isArray(): " + array.isArray()).println(); /* True */
("orcish.isArray(): " + orcish.isArray()).println(); /* False */ 
"".println();

/* A collection qualifies as an array if it has ONLY natural numbers ( including zero ) as keys
and the keys have no holes inbetween */

/* If your collection is an array, you can loop through it without the 
rewind-pastEnd-next combo: */

for(i = 0; i < array.size(); i = i+1)
	("Funk got you covered, " + array[i]).println();
	
"".println();

/* You can also check if a collection has a certain key or value: */
("Array has 'boy': " + array.hasValue("boy")).println(); /* True */
("Orcish knows 'Quel': " + orcish.has("Quel")).println(); /* False; silly, that's night elf for 'high' */
"".println();

/* You can also query a collection's keys or values as an array. Let's use this to create 
a reverse of our orcish collection: */
orcishKeys = orcish.keys;
orcishVals = orcish.values;
phrases = !.Collection();

for(i = 0; i < orcish.size(); i = i+1) 
	phrases[orcishVals[i]] = orcishKeys[i]; 
	
"Some phrases translated into orcish: ".println();
for(phrases.rewind(); phrases.pastEnd() == False; phrases.next())
	(phrases.key + ": " + phrases.value).println();
"".println();

/* Note that collections retain their entries in the order you add them. This means you can 
sort them by keys or by values, once somebody implements that. */
