# Funk #

Home to the infamous Funk language and interpreter ( yes, yet another language called 'funk' )

This is a language we made for one of our courses at the University of Debrecen. 

## Quick guide ##

To figure out how the language works, see the **examples** directory. 
Start with **learn.funk**, and cherry-pick from there on. 

You can see the result of us brainstorming in the **proposals** directory. These explain a single feature and how 
it could be used from the language. Most of these features are implemented at the point of this writing. 

You can see the interpreter source in the **src** directory. We use ANTLR4 to generate a Java parser. 

The repo is also the root of an eclipse project, so feel free to open it as such.
